# InPage2Uni - InPage to Unicode Converter

A lightweight, privacy-focused web application that converts legacy InPage-encoded Sindhi/Urdu text to standard Unicode format. Built with React and designed for writers, publishers, and digital archivists who need to migrate content from proprietary font-based systems to modern, universally-supported text encoding.

## Features

- **Complete Character Support**: Handles basic characters, ligatures, diacritics, numerals, and punctuation
- **High Performance**: Processes up to 20,000 characters in under 200ms
- **Privacy-First**: All processing happens locally in your browser - no data is sent to servers
- **RTL Support**: Proper text direction handling for Arabic/Urdu scripts
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly across all devices and screen sizes
- **WCAG-AA Compliant**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Real-time Feedback**: Character counts, unmapped character highlighting, and conversion statistics

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd inpage2uni
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Usage

1. **Input Text**: Paste or type your InPage-encoded text in the left textarea
2. **Convert**: Click the "Convert" button to process the text
3. **Review Output**: Check the converted Unicode text in the right textarea
4. **Handle Unmapped Characters**: Any characters that couldn't be mapped will be highlighted in orange
5. **Copy Result**: Use the "Copy Result" button to copy the converted text to your clipboard

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

- **ConversionInterface**: Main conversion UI with dual-pane layout
- **ConversionService**: Handles text processing and character mapping
- **TextArea Components**: RTL/LTR aware text input and output areas
- **ConversionStats**: Real-time character counting and error reporting

### Character Mapping

The application uses a comprehensive mapping table stored in `src/services/mockData/inPageMappings.json` that includes:

- **Basic Characters**: All standard Sindhi/Urdu alphabet characters
- **Diacritics**: Fatha, Damma, Kasra, Shadda, Sukun, and special marks
- **Numerals**: Arabic-Indic digits (٠-٩)
- **Punctuation**: Arabic comma, semicolon, question mark, and special symbols
- **Ligatures**: Common character combinations like Lam-Alef

### Performance Optimizations

- **Chunked Processing**: Large texts are processed in chunks to maintain responsiveness
- **Efficient Mapping**: Uses Map data structure for O(1) character lookup
- **Debounced Input**: Prevents excessive processing during typing
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of conversion results
